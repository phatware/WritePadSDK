99202 ("PhatWare"), and Licensee.

PhatWare has developed certain computer software more fully described in
Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Software") and provides such Software to
Licensee subject to Licensee’s agreement to the terms hereunder. This is
an application development license only, and Licensee has no rights

developed with the Software or that contain any portion of the Software
without a separate written agreement with PhatWare.

**LICENSE**

-   Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, PhatWare hereby grants to Licensee a royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use the
    Software only for development and testing of software applications
    only with the operating system specified in Exhibit B attached
    hereto, only in the location specified in Exhibit B and only for the
    term of this Agreement. Only when incorporated into an application
    developed with the Software, Licensee may make up to five (5) copies
    of the object code libraries identified in the product documentation
    as distributed components solely for internal application testing
    purposes or for direct demonstration of the application to
    prospective customers.
-   Limitations. Licensee shall not offer for sale, sell, license,
    sublicense, distribute or transmit such applications, the Software,
    or any portion thereof incorporated into such applications without
    obtaining the appropriate distribution license from PhatWare.
    Licensee shall not modify, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer,
    rent, lease, loan or transfer the Software. Licensee shall not make
    any copies of the Software except as necessary to use the Software
    in accordance with this Agreement.

**NONDISCLOSURE**

-   Confidential Obligations. Licensee agrees to hold the Software and
    any features, output produced by, and other information in writing
    relating to the Software which is marked as confidential
    (collectively referred to as the "Confidential Information") in
    strict confidence for a period of two years and not to disclose the
    Confidential Information in whole or in part to any third party or
    any person other than Licensee's employees whose job performance
    requires access to the Confidential Information. Licensee will
    ensure that any person permitted access to the Confidential
    Information has signed a written non-disclosure agreement and does
    not disclose or provide the Confidential Information to others.
    Licensee agrees to employ all reasonable steps to protect the
    Confidential Information from unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure
    or unauthorized use, including but not limited to all steps that it
    takes to protect its own information that it considers proprietary
    and trade secret.
-   Exceptions. Licensee shall have no obligation to maintain
    confidentiality of any information which (a) is or becomes part of
    the public domain through no act or omission of Licensee; (b) was in
    Licensee's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not
    been obtained by Licensee either directly or indirectly from
    PhatWare; (c) is lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party
    without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed
    by Licensee without use of any Confidential Information.

**WARRANTY, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION**

-   Limited Software Warranty. PhatWare warrants only to Licensee the
    following for a period of thirty (30) days after shipment: (i) the
    media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in
    materials and workmanship; (ii) that the Software will perform
    substantially in accordance with the functional description provided
    in the accompanying documentation. Licensee’s exclusive remedy, and
    PhatWare’s entire liability under this limited warranty, shall be,
    at PhatWare’s option, to repair or replace the Software as
    appropriate.
-   Disclaimer. THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE CONSTITUTES THE
    ONLY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE. PHATWARE MAKES AND
    LICENSEE RECEIVES NO OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
    WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW)
    WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE. PHATWARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. PHATWARE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS
    ERROR-FREE OR THAT OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE SECURE OR
    UNINTERRUPTED. PHATWARE EXERCISES NO CONTROL OVER AND EXPRESSLY
    DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR
    BASED UPON VALUE OR CONTENT OF INFORMATION TRANSMITTED, OR THE
    RESULTS OR EFFECT OF SUCH TRANSMISSION, BY ANY PARTY USING THE
    SOFTWARE.
-   Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL PHATWARE BE LIABLE TO
    LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM USE
    OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER RESULTING FROM A TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE) BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHER FORM OF ACTION, INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL AND
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS
    AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND
    NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.
    Licensee expressly assumes all responsibility for any damages, lost
    data, lost profits and other consequential damages that may result
    in any way related to this Agreement, including without limitation,
    use of the Software.
-   Indemnification. PhatWare shall, at its expense, indemnify and hold
    Licensee harmless from and against any award of damages or
    PhatWare-approved settlement arising from a claim based on an
    allegation that the Software infringes a third party’s US patent or
    copyright, provided that: (i) Licensee promptly gives PhatWare
    written notice of the claim; (ii) Licensee provides all reasonable
    assistance in the defense of the claim; and (iii) PhatWare controls
    the defense or settlement of the claim. If a permanent injunction is
    obtained against the use of the Software or if, in PhatWare’s
    opinion, such an injunction is likely to be obtained, PhatWare may,
    at its sole option, obtain the right to continued use of the
    Software, substitute other equivalent software, or modify the
    Software so it is no longer infringing. The foregoing indemnity does
    not apply to any infringement claim arising if the Software: (i) has
    been modified by parties other than PhatWare; (ii) has been used in
    conjunction with other software and/or hardware which gives rise to
    an infringement claim if the use of the Software alone would not
    give rise to such infringing situation; or (iii) is other than the
    most current version if use of such current version would have
    avoided the infringing situation. THE FOREGOING SECTION SETS FORTH
    THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF PHATWARE AND LICENSEE’S SOLE REMEDIES FOR
    INFRINGEMENT AND ALLEGATIONS OF INFRINGEMENT.

**OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE**

-   Ownership. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all right, title,
    and interest in and to the Software, including without limitation
    any and all copyrights, patents, patent applications, trade secrets,
    and other intellectual property rights embodied therein, are and
    shall at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of
    PhatWare. Licensee further agrees that it shall not earn or
    otherwise acquire any rights or licenses under any copyrights,
    patents, trade secrets, trademarks or other intellectual property on
    account of this Agreement or Licensee's performance Exhibit
    hereunder.
-   Assignment. Licensee is under no obligation to make suggestions for
    change and improvement; however, if Licensee does make any such
    suggestions, Licensee agrees to promptly disclose and hereby assigns
    to PhatWare any such suggestions for change and improvement to any
    of the Software and to assist PhatWare, at PhatWare’s expense, in
    obtaining intellectual property protection relating to such
    suggestions as PhatWare may reasonably require.

**FEES AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT**

-   The fee for the license provided hereunder is specified in Exhibit
    B. Exhibit B also specifies how many hours, if any, of engineering
    support are included with this fee. If the support option is
    included, the specified amount of hours of telephone or email
    engineering support on a best efforts basis will be provided during
    effective time of this Agreement or if the purchased support limit
    is reached. Telephone and email contact information will be provided
    to you. Additional engineering support is available at the
    then-current rate, subject to availability.

**TERM AND TERMINATION**

-   The term of this Agreement is one (1) year unless extended by mutual
    agreement. PhatWare may terminate this Agreement at any time if
    Licensee breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement
    and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) days upon receipt of
    written notice of breach.

**RETURN OF PRODUCTS**

-   Upon expiration or termination, or unless Licensee otherwise
    licenses the Software for distribution, the rights and licenses
    granted to Licensee hereunder with respect to the Software shall
    automatically terminate. Licensee shall, within five (5) days of
    expiration or termination, ship to PhatWare or destroy (including
    purging from any system or storage media) all copies of the Software
    and any other Confidential Information relating thereto. A duly
    authorized representative of Licensee shall certify to PhatWare that
    all copies of the Software and Confidential Information relating
    thereto have been returned to PhatWare or destroyed.

**GENERAL**

-   Injunctive Relief. Licensee acknowledges that any unauthorized
    disclosure or use of the Software and/or Confidential Information
    would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to PhatWare
    which could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages.
    Accordingly, Licensee agrees that PhatWare shall have the right to
    an immediate injunction due to any breach of this Agreement with
    respect to the intellectual property rights or the Confidential
    Information of PhatWare, in addition to any other remedies that may
    be available to PhatWare at law or in equity.
-   Survival. The provisions of Sections 2, 4, 5, and 7 shall survive
    the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
-   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
    accordance with the laws of California, excluding that body of law
    known as choice of law. Licensee hereby consents to the personal and
    exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the northern district of
    California federal and state courts, as applicable.
-   Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
    invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
    remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and
    effect, and the provision or portion thereof affected shall be
    construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible
    by law.
-   Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the attached exhibits
    constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties
    regarding the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except
    by written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each
    party.
-   No Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by Licensee
    without the prior written consent of PhatWare, and any attempt to
    assign without such consent shall be null and void.
